# Install Hybrid Knowledge Base

Paste the following prompt into the target project's coding agent session from the project root.

```text
I want to install the hybrid knowledge base starter kit from the `https://github.com/anuragk16/engineering-recipes` repository into this project.

Source directory to read from:
- `knowledge-base/templates/`
- `knowledge-base/templates/advanced/`
- `knowledge-base/templates/.kb-config.yml`
- `knowledge-base/templates/CLAUDE.section.md`
- `knowledge-base/scripts/validate_hybrid_kb.py`
- `claude/agents/knowledge-base-manager/knowledge-base-manager.md`
- `claude/agents/knowledge-base-manager/README.md`

Follow these steps exactly:

1. Explore this project shallowly:
   - README
   - top-level config files
   - top-level directory structure
   - the 5 most recent git commits
2. Check whether `knowledge-base/` already exists.
   - If it exists, do not overwrite files silently. Show me what exists and ask how to proceed.
3. Create `knowledge-base/` using the numbered hybrid contract:
   - `00-master.md`
   - `01-business-flows/00-index.md`
   - `02-architecture/00-index.md`
   - `03-risk-model/00-index.md`
   - `04-active-sprint/00-index.md`
   - `.kb-config.yml`
4. Evaluate whether Tier 2 is needed for this project.
   - Use evidence only from the codebase and project docs.
   - Consider Tier 2 justified only when the project shows real complexity such as:
     - recurring incidents or fragile areas
     - multiple external integrations
     - long-lived architecture decisions worth preserving
     - hard technical or business constraints
     - meaningful shipped feature history that would help onboarding
   - If Tier 2 does NOT appear justified, recommend Tier 1 only.
5. If Tier 2 may be useful, present a recommendation table before creating any Tier 2 files.
   For each optional file below, mark one of: `Recommend`, `Optional`, `Do Not Recommend`, and give a one-line reason.
   - `advanced/decision-log.md`
   - `advanced/incident-log.md`
   - `advanced/feature-history.md`
   - `advanced/integration-map.md`
   - `advanced/metrics.md`
   - `advanced/known-constraints.md`
6. Ask me whether I want Tier 2 for this project.
   - If I say no: continue with Tier 1 only.
   - If I say yes: ask me to confirm exactly which Tier 2 files to include, using your recommendations as the default suggestion.
   - Do not create any Tier 2 files until I confirm the selection.
7. Copy the reusable helper scripts into `knowledge-base/scripts/`.
8. Check whether `.claude/agents/knowledge-base-manager.md` already exists.
   - If it does not exist:
     - create `.claude/agents/` if needed
     - copy `claude/agents/knowledge-base-manager/knowledge-base-manager.md` into `.claude/agents/knowledge-base-manager.md`
   - If it already exists: do not overwrite it silently. Mention that it already exists in your summary.
9. Replace placeholders only when you can infer values confidently from the codebase.
10. If a value cannot be inferred confidently, leave the placeholder unchanged and list it in your summary. Do not guess.
11. Add the `Knowledge Base` section from `CLAUDE.section.md` to the project root `CLAUDE.md` if it is not already present.
12. Ensure the project root `CLAUDE.md` has a `Custom Agents` section that includes `knowledge-base-manager`.
    - If the section is missing, create it.
    - If the section exists but does not list `knowledge-base-manager`, add it.
    - Do not duplicate an existing entry.
13. At the end, show me:
   - files created
   - placeholders inferred
   - placeholders left unresolved
   - whether Tier 2 was recommended
   - which Tier 2 files were recommended vs not recommended
   - Tier 2 modules enabled
   - whether `knowledge-base-manager` agent was installed or already existed
   - the exact validation command I should run from this project's root:
     `python3 knowledge-base/scripts/validate_hybrid_kb.py .`
```
